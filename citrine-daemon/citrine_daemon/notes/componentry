I want to have:

- libcitrine == basically the stuff in "core" and a little in "package" -- load a zipfile, expose a pythonic API
    for the people who have some project that don't want to use a web server

- cluster stuff probably goes in daemon

- citrine-training: linked with citrine-daemon, but separates out any actual training library
    daemon manages
        - datasets
        - parameter server (maybe?)
        - job control
    training manages torch crap
