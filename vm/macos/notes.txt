macos_put_extradata.sh
	bootloops until I run this
	configured for the name "hivemind_build_macos"
	create the machine, try to run it, fail, shutdown, run script, boot
	
no input on boot
	Apparently requires extension pack?
	In this dir, or https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1
	sudo vboxmanage extpack install <fpath>
	Not sure if this actually did anything, but it works. Try without on next virtualbox install

Installer can't be used to install macos
	Disconnect box from internet
		settings -> network -> enable network adapter
	Start machine
	Boot, language, utilities -> terminal
	date 030300002019
	quit, continue

No drives listed
	run disk utility first, format the vdi
	Mac calls the format operation "erase"

Installation takes forever
	yeah
	it's not stuck, just slow
	let it go overnight
	Crashes at the end but apparently it's OK

SSH
	settings

Python
	Apparently the .pkg doesn't work so good with pyinstaller
	curl https://pyenv.run | bash
	echo the thing to bashrc and source it
	env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework" pyenv install 3.7.7
	might have to install the xcode thing first. Dialog pops up in gui
