VM requires some setup:

- Install windows
	Click through setup
	user "build" / pass "build"

- Set up SSH
	win
	-> manage optional features
	-> add a feature
	-> openssh
	(There might be more to start it, don't remember entirely)

- Virtualbox port forwarding
	settings
	-> network
	-> Advanced
	-> Port forwarding
	Name: ssh-windows-build
	Protocol: TCP
	Host IP: 127.0.0.1
	Host Port: 3022
	Guest IP: $(in powershell, "ipconfig" --> IPv4 Address)
	Guest Port: 22

- Install python3.7 
	SCP the binary (in this directory) (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
	gui navigate C:\Users\build and click it

- vc_redist.x64.exe
    may contain some DLLs that are needed somewhere?
    try it without next time I'm setting up windows

- Run python
	Whatever shell you enter with the default SSH is bad.
	Run "powershell" and then things start to work.
