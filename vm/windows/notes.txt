VM requires some setup:

- Install windows
	Click through setup
	user "build" / pass "build"

- Set up SSH
	win
	-> manage optional features
	-> add a feature
	-> openssh
	(There might be more to start it, don't remember entirely)

- Virtualbox port forwarding
	settings
	-> network
	-> Advanced
	-> Port forwarding
	Name: ssh-windows-build
	Protocol: TCP
	Host IP: 127.0.0.1
	Host Port: 3022
	Guest IP: $(in powershell, "ipconfig" --> IPv4 Address)
	Guest Port: 22

- Install python3.7 
	SCP the binary (in this directory) (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
	gui navigate C:\Users\build and click it

- vc_redist.x64.exe
    may contain some DLLs that are needed somewhere?
    try it without next time I'm setting up windows

- Run python
	Whatever shell you enter with the default SSH is bad.
	Run "powershell" and then things start to work.

- Windows SDK
	Required for making MSIX package
	    Maybe not required if using wix? see below
	    MSIX requires code signing, bleagh
	SCP the binary (in this directory) (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
	gui navigate C:\Users\build and click it
	I want components:
		- MSI tools
		- SDK for UWP managed apps
	This... downloads a downloader? Which I then ran again and it downloaded a bunch of installers
		C:\Users\build\Downloads\Windows Kits\10\WindowsSDK\Installers\*.msi
	Which I then ran one by one until the proper files exist
		C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\x86\makeappx.exe
	Then I ran the rest of them because it was angry about side-by-side configuration

- Wix
    Binaries from https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/tag/wix3112rtm
    unzip to C:\users\build\wix
